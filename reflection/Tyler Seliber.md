# Reflection - Tyler Seliber
Over the past two milestones, you've had the opportunity to apply several software engineering practices and processes in the design and implementation of a bot project.

## Design
1. **What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?** <br>
Thinking about the design methods of our project proved really beneficial in defining its scope. By identifying the exact problem we were trying to solve and what a potential solution would look like, we were able to design UML use case diagrams on what the processes would look like. This provided us with the flows of interactions necessary to model our code after.

2. **What was most difficult? What would you do differently?** <br>


3. **What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?** <br>



## Implementation
1. **What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?** <br>


2. **What was most difficult? What would you do differently?** <br>


3. **What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?** <br>



## Process
1. **What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?** <br>


2. **What was most difficult? What would you do differently?** <br>


3. **What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?** <br>



## Overall
Considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you've encountered---**compare and contrast** how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.
