# Reflection
Over the past two milestones, you've had the opportunity to apply several software engineering practices and processes in the design and implementation of a bot project. (Links to an external site.)

## Design
1. What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?
2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
3. What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

## Implementation
1. What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?
2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
3. What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

## Process
1. What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?
2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
3. What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?

## Overall
Considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you've encountered---**compare and contrast** how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.
