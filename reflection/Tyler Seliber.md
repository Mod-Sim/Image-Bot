# Reflection - Tyler Seliber
Over the past two milestones, you've had the opportunity to apply several software engineering practices and processes in the design and implementation of a bot project.

## Design
1. **What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?** <br>
Thinking about the design methods of our project proved really beneficial in defining its scope. By identifying the exact problem we were trying to solve and what a potential solution would look like, we were able to design UML use case diagrams on what the processes would look like. This provided us with the flows of interactions necessary to model our code after. Planning out the architecture design was also extremely helpful because it made us research the available resources to implement this project so we'd have a more concrete plan and have clear goals for what needs to be done.

2. **What was most difficult? What would you do differently?** <br>
Since we collectively had little experience with developing Discord bots, we weren't able to select definitive resources during the design phase. This came with the additional challenge of not only discovering the resources, but also analyzing which would be best to proceed with. For example, one of the major decisions was whether to base our bot on JavaScript or Python. With little experience, we were indifferent to both but needed to make an informed decision as to which to use. Additionally, due to our lack of prior experience we were not prepared for the roadblocks that came during implementation as we haven't considered them during design. If we were more familiar with the particular implementations we would like to take, we would have been able to plan better.

3. **What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?** <br>
For future projects, I will dedicate more time to following the many design methods before I begin to implement a solution. Identifying the problem, proposing a solution, and planning all the various parts in between (use cases, architecture, design patterns) will certainly help me to efficiently implement the solution and provide more confidence while doing so.


## Implementation
1. **What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?** <br>


2. **What was most difficult? What would you do differently?** <br>


3. **What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?** <br>



## Process
1. **What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?** <br>


2. **What was most difficult? What would you do differently?** <br>


3. **What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?** <br>



## Overall
Considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you've encountered---**compare and contrast** how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.
