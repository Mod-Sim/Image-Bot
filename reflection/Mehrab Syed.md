# Reflection - Mehrab Syed
Over the past two milestones, you've had the opportunity to apply several software engineering practices and processes in the design and implementation of a bot project.

## Design
1. **What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?** <br>
Using the Design and UX concepts we learned earlier in the year really helped with our project. The UML activity and use case diagrams helped define the function and scope of our project and provided a solid foundation on how to develop our code from there. 


2. **What was most difficult? What would you do differently?** <br>
The most difficult aspect of our project was the learning curve for coding the bot. Most of the team did not have prior experience coding discord bots so a lot of time went into researching documentation and figuring out bugs. In the future, it would be helpful to stick with a technology the team is familiar with or dedicate the pre-development into learning these languages through online resources.


3. **What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?** <br>
I think creating story boards and assigning points is something I hope to implement in future projects. This process ensures that the team is focusing on the right functions and not wasting time on “nice to have” features instead. Also, UML use case and class diagrams proved valuable when developing the bot.


## Implementation
1. **What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?** <br>
The documentation created by Tyler in the project’s READ ME file was most helpful in implementing and testing the bot. There’s many steps that go into setting up the development environment such as retrieving the bot token, setting up discord in developer mode, and running command lines. Tyler did a good job documenting all the steps needed to develop and run the bot project and the links to resources and troubleshooting also helped. Once figured out, the bot was very simple to run locally and test. 




2. **What was most difficult? What would you do differently?** <br>
Connecting to the Google Image API was difficult when it came to implementing. For some reason, I was not able to successfully do so on my own- most likely due to insufficient permissions. Additionally, debugging the code was difficult because of the nature of the discord bot. Since encapsulation was not as strong (as there is high interdependency in the project files, it was difficult to find the source of the error.


3. **What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?** <br>
For future projects, using Git to collaborate and using APIs is a great way to improve collaboration, keep track and update releveant changes, and get data in the most efficient way possible. The Google Image Search and Discord APIs made it much simpler to develop from a base instead of starting from scratch. 



## Process
1. **What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?** <br>
Kanban and code reviews made it very easy to assign tasks and keep the team updated on the status of those tasks. That way, every team member knows exactly what to work on and accountability is taken care of. Code Reviews also were helpful in catching any errors a team member may have overlooked and for cleaning code and reducing code smell. By having multiple people review the code, merging issues were minimized.


2. **What was most difficult? What would you do differently?** <br>
The most difficult aspect was accommodating everyone’s schedules and finding times to meet consistently. However, we were able to set weekly times that worked for everyone and were able to work on the project together. In the future, setting up those weekly meetings beforehand and establishing expectations for the team would be great.


3. **What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?** <br>
Implementing the Kanban boards and assigning tasks is something I will implement in future projects. Using sites like “Jira” helped keep my summer internship team very organized and on the same page and it proved useful for the bot project as well. 


## Overall
**Considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you've encountered---*compare and contrast* how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.**
