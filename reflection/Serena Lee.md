Reflection
Over the past few milestones, you've had the opportunity to apply several software engineering practices and processes in the design and implementation of a project.

Design
What was most helpful about thinking about design and architecture of your project?

What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

Testing
What was most helpful about implementing integration tests and mocking in your project?

What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

What testing methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

Process
What was most helpful about implementing scrum-ban in your project?

What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?

Overall
Considering all the design and architecture methods, testing practices, and software processes you've encountered---compare and constrast how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.
