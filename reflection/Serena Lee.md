## Reflection
- Over the past two milestones, you've had the opportunity to apply several software engineering practices and processes in the design and implementation of a bot project. (Links to an external site.)

# Design
- What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?
- 

- What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

- What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?


# Implementation
- What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?

- What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

- What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?


# Process
- What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?

After implementing kanban and code review into our project, working and assigning tasks has been a lot simpler. Before using the kanban board, we verbally decided and assigned the tasks that we needed to complete and within a few hours, we'd forget what we have to do. Now we are able to easily make new tasks and assign it to group members without worrying that someone would forget. Code reviewing has also been a helpful tool for us because our group members often overlook some small details or are struggling on a part of code, so by having the code review feature, another member can double check for any mistakes or help solve the issue.

- What was most difficult? What would you do differently?


The most difficult was finding a time for everyone to work on the project together. Some members had some trouble testing the bot when they were doing the project by themselves and it was hard to communicate and solve the issue through texts. If we were to do this again, we'd definitely dedicate more time to coding the project in person, to reduce the time we would spend struggling and putting that time towards advancing in the project.

- What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?


I would definitely use the kanban board again in projects in the future. For my Design VI project, I started using the kanban board and my group's progress significantly got better. Before using the kanban board, we'd verbally say what we were going to do and all of us forgot what we were going to do and there were a lot of times where multiple members were working on the same feature. After implementing the kanban board, we were able to break up the work more evenly and work more efficiently, getting the tasks done in a fraction of the time.


# Overall
- Considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you've encountered---compare and contrast how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.
