1) Reminder Bot

2) 
a - The core problem the Reminder Bot is trying to solve is that many people, especially students, tend to get absorbed into their computer screens and forget to take breaks, lose track of time easily, or get easily distracted. The bot would be the solution to remind the user to take breaks after a long session of staring at their computer screen, to keep track of how long they've been doing something, or to keep them on track of the task they are supposed to be doing.

b - The problem is worth solving because many people nowadays spend a lot of their time on technology, either via phone, laptop, tablet, etc. and have become "addicted" to it and can spend hours on it without taking any breaks. Staring at a screen for long periods of time is unhealthy, regardless if you're being productive or not, the body needs breaks to recharge and let loose.
