# Final Report

## Problem
Currently on Discord, there is no feature that allows the user to search and send pictures to others straight from the platform itself. Users have to go onto their browser and search, choose, and copy/download the picture they want and go back to Discord and send it to the other party. With our bot, we eliminated all these extra steps and made it possible for the user to search, browse, and send a picture all in one command.
