# Final Report

## Problem
Currently on Discord, there is no feature that allows the user to search and send pictures to others straight from the platform itself. Users have to go onto their browser and search, choose, and copy/download the picture they want and go back to Discord and send it to the other party. With our bot, we eliminated all these extra steps and made it possible for the user to search, browse, and send a picture all in one command.

## Features
Out bot allows users to search for and browse images powered by Google Images. To implement this, we took advantage of Discord's new slash commands for an optimal user experience. To search for images, users use the `/search ` command, which prompts for a search term/phrase. An example of using `/search bell labs` can be seen below:

<img width="517" alt="Search Example" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42685071/167278448-6464d68c-5761-424e-b9d1-2fe3826eab1a.png">

Search results are formatted as message embeds, and include the following:
- Message indicating the search term with a hyperlink to the custom search engine's webpage for that search term
- An indicator of which result is being displayed
- The title of the webpage that the image is from
- The name of the website that the image is from
- The image itself

In addition, there are buttons below the embed that allow users to interact with the results. Users can browse between image results, and the message embed dynamically updates. There is an additional button to view the original website that image was published on.

## Reflection
Your reflection on the development process and project

## Limitations 
One of our biggest limitations was not being able to find time where everyone could meet and do the project together. Instead, we met mainly on Discord and communicated all our problems and questions to each other on the platform. Because we did not meet in person, whenever we had problems with our code, it was difficult to convey the issue and solve it online.
