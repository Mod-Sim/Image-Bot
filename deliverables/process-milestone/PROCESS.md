- [x] First Iteration *search image*
- [ ] Second Iteration *browse multiple images*

### FIRST ITERATION 💭
- The first iteration focused not only on searching for an image but the creation of the bot and laying the foundation for the next iteration.
- Worked with a search api to connect with our bot as the first step.
- Next step was configuring the bot to receive and answer user requests.
- Last was implementing the search api into the user and bot request system.

### SECOND ITERATION 💭
- After implementing the search function, we started working on how to modify the search function to show multiple results of the input.
- The end goal is to show the user 15 image results of the input.
- We also have to fix some bugs, especially to inputs that share parts of the same name, i.e. Stevens Institute of Technology, Rochester Institute of Technology, Florida Institute of Technology - only Florida Institute of Technology shows up.

📘 *scum notes* 📘

**March 30, 2022**
- *Key Points* : By the last week of April we must have the basics of our bot working and key concepts ready. 
- *During Meeting* : Tyler will help structure the bot for us and understands how to build a discord bot already so he can be big help. We decided to rethink our bot to be more simply due to time and how busy our members are.
- *Action* : Tyler → start bot structure and basic functionality, Mya → make discord environment, continue watch for readability issues, and working on milestone requirements such as use cases, Serena → find a search API to use and test, Mehrab → help with testing and debugging as well as any other tasks that need to be done.

**Apr 14, 2022**
- *Key Points* : Foundation of the bot is pretty much built 
- *During the meeting* : explaining how the bot will work and the use of the search api 
- *Action* : same tasks as last meeting + team members putting tasking into the kanban board.

**April 20, 2022** 
- *Key Points* : bot can now take requests from users in a channel and give back first image in Google search.
- *During the meeting* : talked about other improvements and 2nd iteration to pick from multiple images (how and what we would do) 
- *Action* : keeping up with pull requests and merging, looking into browsing images and picking the desired image. 

## Process Reflection
Working Process
- All of us underestimated how busy we would all be so we never dedicated a large amount of time to work on the project together. We had several short meetings about what we needed to do and what has been done and then we would work on the bot ourselves. There were quite a few times where some of the members would be having difficulty with running the bot, which wouldn’t have happened had we coded together, but it was solved through a few texts. Overall, with the progress we made during the past few weeks, it was good work, but we would’ve spent less time facing technical issues had we done it together.

Bot
- Overall, the bot we have currently satisfies our #1 goal for this project. We wanted to be able to search for images on Discord without having to go to another tab and manually search for the image. Our next goal, which we are currently working on, is to allow the user to choose for the image they want instead of just showing the first result of the image. This feature will allow the user to have more mobility in the bot.
